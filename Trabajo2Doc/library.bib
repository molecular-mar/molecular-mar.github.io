abstract = {NOTT-401 was found to be a highly stable adsorbent for SO2 and CO with excellent cyclability and a straightforward regeneration at room temperature. Moreover, the preferential CO binding sites within the MOF material have been identified by experimental in situ DRIFT spectroscopy coupled with DFT and QTAIM calculations. Such preferential CO adsorption sites were correlated to identify the most significant SO2 interactions within NOTT-401. This study sheds light on the role of the thiophene and hydroxo functionality, for a MOF material, in the binding of SO2 or CO. This journal is},

@article{Oliveira2020,
abstract = {First-principles electronic structure calculations are now accessible to a very large community of users across many disciplines, thanks to many successful software packages, some of which are described in this special issue. The traditional coding paradigm for such packages is monolithic, i.e., regardless of how modular its internal structure may be, the code is built independently from others, essentially from the compiler up, possibly with the exception of linear-algebra and message-passing libraries. This model has endured and been quite successful for decades. The successful evolution of the electronic structure methodology itself, however, has resulted in an increasing complexity and an ever longer list of features expected within all software packages, which implies a growing amount of replication between different packages, not only in the initial coding but, more importantly, every time a code needs to be re-engineered to adapt to the evolution of computer hardware architecture. The Electronic Structure Library (ESL) was initiated by CECAM (the European Centre for Atomic and Molecular Calculations) to catalyze a paradigm shift away from the monolithic model and promote modularization, with the ambition to extract common tasks from electronic structure codes and redesign them as open-source libraries available to everybody. Such libraries include "heavy-duty" ones that have the potential for a high degree of parallelization and adaptation to novel hardware within them, thereby separating the sophisticated computer science aspects of performance optimization and re-engineering from the computational science done by, e.g., physicists and chemists when implementing new ideas. We envisage that this modular paradigm will improve overall coding efficiency and enable specialists (whether they be computer scientists or computational scientists) to use their skills more effectively and will lead to a more dynamic evolution of software in the community as well as lower barriers to entry for new developers. The model comes with new challenges, though. The building and compilation of a code based on many interdependent libraries (and their versions) is a much more complex task than that of a code delivered in a single self-contained package. Here, we describe the state of the ESL, the different libraries it now contains, the short- and mid-term plans for further libraries, and the way the new challenges are faced. The ESL is a community initiative into which several pre-existing codes and their developers have contributed with their software and efforts, from which several codes are already benefiting, and which remains open to the community.},

@article{Cruz2019,
abstract = {The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) generated by quantum chemistry methods and Gaussian functions is evaluated over graphics processing units (GPUs). This implementation is based on full-range Rys polynomials with nodes and weights obtained in each thread of a GPU. For high angular moments, the corresponding integral is solved using a one-dimension vertical recurrence relation. Thus, we computed the MEP with minimal approximations. We show that this implementation is stable and very efficient since the time consumed over GPUs is quite small compared with similar implementations over CPUs. The implementation was done by using CUDA-C programming techniques within the Graphics Processing Units for Atoms and Molecules (GPUAM) project, which has been designed to analyze quantum chemistry fields over heterogeneous computational resources. With this new scalar field GPUAM is a useful application for the quantum chemistry community, in particular for people interested in chemical reactivity analysis.},

@article{Ibarra2020,
abstract = {The fluorescent properties of MIL-53(Al)-TDC are drastically changed due to the presence of iodine, even in small quantities, as a result of an energy transfer process from the host material (MIL-53(Al)-TDC) to the guest molecule (I2). While MIL-53(Al)-TDC's emission spectrum shows a weak and broad band, after I2 adsorption, it exhibits well-resolved and long-lasting emission lines, which could be exploited for iodine detection. Density Functional Theory periodical calculations demonstrated that in the most stable MIL-53(Al)-TDC⋯I2 configuration, the I2 molecule is bonded mainly by an O-H⋯I hydrogen bond. The QTAIM showed that other non-covalent interactions also provided stability to MIL-53(Al)-TDC⋯I2. The electrostatic potential analysis indicated that the I2 molecule adsorption occurs by a combination of specific interactions with a strong electrostatic contribution and weak interactions. These results postulate fluorescent MIL-53(Al)-TDC as an efficient I2 detector (potentially for radioactive I2), using a simple fluorimetric test.},
